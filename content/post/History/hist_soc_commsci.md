title: Historical reflections upon the relationships between sociology and communication science.
---

To get acclimatized in a new field or subfield, what I tend to do is to learn the historical developments of the discipline. As (institutional) newbie in communication science, I decided to dig into the historical relationships between sociology and commsci. After few weeks into my PhD, the literature on media effects seemed more detached from sociological approaches than I expected. Mostly dominated by psychological approaches, the perspectives adopted in the major theories -- even those with a focus on social dimensions, such as cultivation and social cognitive theory -- seemed unable to tackle crucial sociological issues (e.g. power, enculturation, institutionalization). Here a thread about possible historical explanations for this divergence.

In [Pooley and Katz (2008)](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/58/4/767/4098454) it is possible to find a detailed account (and even more detailed sources) of the origins and developments of American commsci. The Chicago School of Sociology has first occupied a prominent place in laying the ground of commsci and later abandoned the efforts to merge sociological approaches with the newly established discipline. The reasons listed are mainly two: shifting fundings, and inability to get institutionalized.

Regarding fundings, the field of public opinions dislodged sociology from the study of media. This field had roots in attitude psychology, market research, and survey-based methodologies, very distant from the theoretical and methodological coordinates of the Chicago sociologists of the time. Columbia and Harvard were the leading universities in this shift.

The inability to institutionalize the field is a direct consequence of the first point. After years of shifting fundings, sociologists missed the self-consciousness and the contacts to establish core journals, university departments and curricula aimed at welding the intersection between sociology and commsci. This happened between the 1950s and 1970s.

[Chen (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428658), however, criticizes this linear demarcation between disciplines, pointing toward collaborative efforts between sociology and commsci dating back until the 1970s. Media sociology has been a vibrant subdiscipline since then, with collaborative efforts and institutionalization practices that are nowadays showing strong connections between the two disciplines (e.g. several top-ranked journals, the CITMAS section of ASA, and the continuous exchange of scholars between the two disciplines).

Despite this, it seems to me that this transfield (media/digitial sociology) still represents something very different than what is the aim of this historical reconstruction. The leading theories in commsci journals and conferences have their roots in psychological, psychophysiological, cognitive, and neuroscientific approaches, with scarce or null attention toward the sociological implications of communication and media in society. On the other side, media/digital sociology seems to be a subdiscipline of sociology rather than a point of intersection between sociologists and commscientists.

Since I have just started finding my way into these intersections, these are rough and imperfect impressions. I thought worth reflecting upon these historical trajectories as we often find ourselves in the middle of theoretical debates without recognizing we have more things in common than imagined.
