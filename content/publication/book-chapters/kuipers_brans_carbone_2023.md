abstract: "This chapter offers an empirical examination of this common account of how fashion works. Do fashion styles ‘trickle-down’? That is, do we see the diffusion of styles from high-status to lower-status actors within countries, and from central to more peripheral fashion fields? We analyse this by looking at European fashion magazines from four countries, over a period of 30 years (1982–2011), focusing on various aesthetic elements. We first look at trickle-down within three national fashion fields, namely, France, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Second, we look at transnational trickle-down from high-status magazines in fashion capitals Milan and Paris to more peripheral countries. Our analysis shows that mechanisms of status-based imitation and trickle-down do not suffice to understand the spread of fashion. To explain a change in fashion, we point to three other processes that interact with, and sometimes counteract, status-based diffusion. First, immediate attunement, that is: the sharing of information and material resources that creates similarity without (much) time lag. Second, identity: the persistence of distinct, durable styles typical of countries, institutions, and social groups and categories. Finally, there is a large residue of ‘endogenous’ change that is not easily captured by sociological mechanisms. We therefore conclude that innovation in fashion does not necessarily come from high-status locations, and that change does not require explicit consecration of high-status actors. Indeed, as the power of fashion magazines is increasingly challenged by fragmented, transnational networks of influencers and platforms, trickle-down is likely to become an (even) less important driver of change."
