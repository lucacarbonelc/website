I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Media Psychology Lab](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc) at the Department of Communication Science at KU Leuven. 
I obtained my PhD at KU Leuven, where I worked as part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu). 
I am affiliated with the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Comparative Inequalities and Inclusion](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone-0) at Harvard University.

I work at the intersection of media psychology and cultural sociology to study media effects on youth's identities and mental health. 
My PhD dissertation particularly focused on music effects on adolescents' success beliefs, while my postdoctoral research focuses on music effects on young men identities and mental health. 
I am also interested in social and communication theory (resonance), algorithms and platforms, online cultures, CSS, SEM, time-sensitive (long- and short-term), multisensory (mobile sensing), and psychometric research.
