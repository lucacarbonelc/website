I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Media Psychology Lab](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc) at Department of Communication Sciences at KU Leuven. I obtained my PhD at KU Leuven, where I worked as part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu). Currently, I am also affiliated with the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Comparative Inequalities and Inclusion](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone-0) at Harvard University.

I work at the intersection of media psychology and sociology to study media effects on youth's identities and mental health, with a specific focus on music. I am also interested in social and communication theory, algorithms and platforms, online cultures, computational social science, multisensory research, and psychometrics.
