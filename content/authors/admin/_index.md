Welcome,

I am Luca, PhD student at the [School for Mass Communication Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc), KU Leuven (BE), where I am part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu). Currently, I am [visiting fellow](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone) at the Harvard Department of Sociology and [Affiliated](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone-0) with the Weatherhead Research Cluster on Comparative Inequalities and Inclusion.

My research focuses on the production of narratives about success (status and meritocracy) in contemporary mainstream cultural products--with a specific focus on music--, their internalization processes among adolescents' beliefs, and the impact of such narratives on adolescents' mental health. I work at the intersection of cultural sociology (cultural objects, symbolic boundaries), media psychology (entertainment, framing), social and media theory (resonance, (post-)Bourdieusian theory, intersectionality, cultivation, narrative persuasion). I use a wide variety of methodologies, dependently on the specific project at hand. Currently, I mostly employ quantitative and computational methods (e.g., SEM, FA, computational text analysis, social network analysis). In my previous research, I also employed historico-archival (with digital and library material) and impact evaluation methodologies (e.g., diff-in-diff).

I also conduct research on social and communication theory (e.g., resonance, forms of culture), events (e.g., Eurovision), online cultures (e.g., conspiracy theories, sexual infidelity, videogames), positive digital communication among youths (e.g., digital balance, digital flourishing), and methodological advancements (e.g., scale development, social network analysis, computational text analysis).
