I am a PhD student at the School for Mass Communication Research, KU Leuven (BE). My research interests lie at the intersection of media effects, cultural and cognitive sociology. From a theoretical point of view, I study the process of belief formation from an embodied perspective, with particular attention to information encoding and storage of multisensory and linguistic stimuli. I apply this reasoning to the specific case of social inequalities and media framing effects: How do individuals form beliefs about poverty? What relationships between their own and others' social class? What role do media have in the formation and internalization of these beliefs? Empirically, I employ quantitative methodologies, such as social network analysis, structural equation modelling, and computational text analysis. I am committed to an open science framework and mindset.
