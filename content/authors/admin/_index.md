Welcome,

I am Luca, PhD student at the [School for Mass Communication Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc), KU Leuven (BE), where I am part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu). My research focuses on the production of narratives about success in contemporary mainstream cultural products--with a specific focus on music--and their internalization processes among adolescents.

My research interests lie at the intersection of cultural sociology (cultural objects, symbolic boundaries), media psychology (entertainment, framing), social and media theory (resonance, (post-)Bourdieusian theory, intersectionality, cultivation, narrative persuasion). I use a wide variety of methodologies, dependently on the specific project at hand. Currently, I mostly employ quantitative and computational methods (e.g., SEM, FA, computational text analysis, social network analysis). In my previous research, I also employed historico-archival (with digital and library material) and impact evaluation methodologies (e.g., diff-in-diff).
