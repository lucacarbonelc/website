I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Media Psychology Lab](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc) at Department of Communication Sciences at KU Leuven. I obtained my PhD at KU Leuven, where I worked as part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu). Currently, I am also affiliated with the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Comparative Inequalities and Inclusion](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone-0) at Harvard University.

I work at the intersection of media psychology and cultural sociology to study the distribution of success narratives in popular culture, with a specific focus on music, and their effects on the identities and mental health of young people. I am also interested in social and communication theory, algorithms and platforms, media events and online cultures, NLP, networks, and psychometrics.
