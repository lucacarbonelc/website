I am a guest professor at the [Institute of Journalism and Communication Research](https://www.ijk.hmtm-hannover.de/en/about/staff/dr-luca-carbone-visiting-professor/) (Hanover Univeristy of Music, Drama, and Media), 
and a fellow at the [Media Psychology Lab](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc) (KU Leuven) and at the [Weatherhead Center](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone-0) (Harvard University).
Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Media Psychology Lab (PDMT2 fellowship), where I also obtained my PhD as part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu).

I work at the intersection of media psychology and cultural sociology to study media effects on youth's identities and mental health. 
My PhD dissertation particularly focused on music effects on adolescents' success beliefs, while my postdoctoral research focused on media resonance effects on young men reactionary identities and mental health.
I am also interested in social and communication theory (resonance), algorithms and platforms, online youth cultures, CSS, time-sensitive (long- and short-term), multisensory (mobile sensing), and psychometric research.
