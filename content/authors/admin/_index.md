Welcome,

I am Luca, PhD student at the [School for Mass Communication Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/smc), KU Leuven (BE), where I am part of the ERC project [MIMIc](https://www.projectmimic.eu). Currently, I am [visiting fellow](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone) at the Harvard Department of Sociology and [Affiliated](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/luca-carbone-0) with the Weatherhead Research Cluster on Comparative Inequalities and Inclusion.

My research maps the production, consumption, and health influences of **success narratives** in popular media, with a specific focus on **mainstream music**, **adolescence**, and **masculinities**. My dissertation investigates the presence and prevalence of narratives about **materialism**, **meritocracy**, **sexual objectification**, and **utilitarianism** in popularly streamed music lyrics. By following a sample of **Flemish adolescents** through 3 years, I further study whether such mainstream narratives are also present in the music of their **favorite artists** and whether they develop similar meritocratic beliefs over time. Through **content analyses**, **computational** and **longitudinal methodologies**, I show the wide presence in mainstream music of neoliberal narratives of success, the contextual support for meritocratic beliefs among adolescents, and **resonance** processes at play in adolescents' **identity developments** when listening to their favorite music.

I work at the intersection of cultural sociology (cultural objects, symbolic boundaries), media psychology (entertainment, framing), social and media theory (resonance, intersectionality, cultivation, narrative persuasion). I use a wide variety of methodologies, dependently on the specific project at hand. Currently, I mostly employ quantitative and computational methods (e.g., SEM, FA, computational text analysis, social network analysis). In my previous research, I also employed historico-archival (with digital and library material) and impact evaluation methodologies (e.g., diff-in-diff).

I also conduct research on social and communication theory (e.g., resonance, forms of culture), events (e.g., Eurovision), online cultures (e.g., conspiracy theories, sexual infidelity, videogames), positive digital communication among youths (e.g., digital balance, digital flourishing), and methodological advancements (e.g., scale development, social network analysis, computational text analysis).
